Hello,
The design of Voron printers does not take into account CSA, UL and other standards for the design of electrical devices. My first idea was to get near it. Then I was inspired by several publications including those of JNP, ZZP8202 and joehou45 for their vision of a drawer that would contain the electronics.
The top and bottom panels as well as the drawer are made of 1.7mm aluminum sheet.  The rails are 400mm.
The fixings, except those of the rails which are those supplied with them, are M3 screws. There are very few nuts. Almost everything is drilled and tapped in aluminum. Which makes fragile threads.  Maybe I should have used thicker sheet metal.

Here are the descriptions of the different STL files that you will find in the folder of the same name:
-   "_bout1-Body.stl", "_bout2-BodyPocket003.stl", "_maille-Body.stl"and "spring.stl" are the components of the drag chain inspired by Claghorn.  I redesigned it so it's larger.  I made 12 links.  Be sure to adjust the chain once the drawer is on.
-   "Equerre glissiere.stl" 4 of them will hold the rails in place on the base plate.
-   "Ã‰querre tiroir-Body.stl is the square profile used in the front of the drawer to attach the skirts.
-   "EquerrePS24 1.stl" and "EquerrePS24 2.stl are bindings for the 24V power supply.  One model is for clamping along the metal sheet.
-   "Jupe avant a avec switch voron bleue-Body.stl" is the front right skirt from which I removed 1 mm from the top and blanked/drilled holes in two hexagons.
-   "rondelle voron.stl" are spacers used between the stock bottom panel and the sheet metal base plate.  There are four of them.
-   "shim 1mm-Body.stl" is a tool to adjust the spacing between the front 2020 frame and the drawer's skirts while driling in the front drawer's square.
-   "Tay cable voron bleue-TrayFillet002.stl and "Tray cable voron bleue-Couvercle.stl" is the L-shaped cable tray on the base plate.
-   "Tay cable voron bleue-Couvercle tiroir.stl", "Tray cable voron bleue-Body tiroir court.stl", "Tray cable voron bleue-Body tiroir" and "Tray cable voron bleue-Couvercle tiroir court.stl" are the drawer's cable trays.
