Hello,
The design of Voron printers does not take into account CSA, UL and other standards for the design of electrical devices. My first idea was to approach it. Then I was inspired by several publications including those of JNP, ZZP8202 and joehou45 for their vision of a drawer that would contain the electronics.
The top and bottom panels as well as the drawer are made of 1.7mm aluminum sheet.  The rails are 400mm.
The fixings, except those of the rails which are those supplied with them, are M3 screws. There are very few nuts. Almost everything is drilled and tapped in aluminum. Which makes fragile threads.  Maybe I should have used thicker sheet metal.
