This the place where i put my Voron's mods.
The last V2.4 I built was modified with:
-   A drawer;
-   A WaveShare 5 inches display;
-   A power/reset switch and
-   Some connections on the back center skirt for the exhaust fan and BTT filament runout sensor.

I'll detail these mods in different sections.
